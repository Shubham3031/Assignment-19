    "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites automatically using software tools,\n",
    "commonly referred to as web scrapers or crawlers. Web scraping involves collecting data that is \n",
    "available on websites and then transforming that data into a structured format that can be analyzed\n",
    "or used in other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for various reasons, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis: Web scraping is used to collect data from different websites and \n",
    "analyze it to extract insights and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business intelligence: Companies use web scraping to gather data on their competitors, \n",
    "monitor pricing, and stay up-to-date on industry trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research: Web scraping is used in academic research to gather data for studies, surveys, \n",
    "and statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three areas where web scraping is used to get data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce: Web scraping is used to gather data on prices, product information, and \n",
    "customer reviews from e-commerce websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media: Web scraping is used to gather data on social media platforms to analyze \n",
    "trends, monitor sentiment, and gather insights about users.\n",
    "\n",
    "News and media: Web scraping is used to collect news articles, headlines, and other data\n",
    "from media outlets for research and analysis purposes."

    "\n",
    "Web scraping software: There are many web scraping tools available that allow users to easily \n",

    "\n",
    "API access: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that \n",
    "allow developers to access their data in a structured way. This method is more reliable and\n",
    "efficient than scraping the HTML directly, but it requires some technical knowledge and may \n",
